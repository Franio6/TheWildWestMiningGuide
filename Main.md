### Key Insights and Recommendations

- **Road Pro Extension**: Highly recommended for quickly switching servers to maximize mining efficiency, as resources respawn slowly.
- **Inventory Management**: Unwanted pickaxes can be deleted to reclaim skill points and re-claimed later, except for the tier zero pickaxe.
- **Graphics Tip**: Turning shadows off improves mine visibility significantly, eliminating the need for a mining helmet.
- **Membership Benefits**: Investing in membership or trading for a trade ticket can facilitate grinding and resource trading.
- **Early Levels (Tier 0 & 1)**: Focus primarily on **grinding XP** by mining **copper and coal** in Copper Glutch. Copper yields more XP but coal still provides valuable free XP.
- **Tier 2**: Unlocks mining **zinc**. The best location is the **Tribal Forest Bear Cave** underneath the tribal camp, with multiple zinc nodes accessible.
- **Tier 3**: Introduces mining **iron**, also found in the Tribal Forest, alongside zinc. Players should fill inventory with zinc after mining iron for extra XP.
- **Tier 4**: Unlocks mining **silver**, marking the start of more valuable mining. Silver nodes are abundant in the Tribal Forest and the Water Cave. Mining iron and zinc as filler remains beneficial.
- **Tier 5**: Grants the ability to mine **gold**, significantly increasing money gains. Gold and silver mining routes overlap, mainly around the Water Cave. Keeping inventory full with zinc, iron, and silver maximizes XP.
- **Tier 6 & 7**: Unlock **quartz** and bigger nodes respectively, but quartz is considered less efficient for XP/money. Larger nodes take longer to mine and don’t improve yields, so the prior routes remain optimal.
- **Tier 8**: Enables mining large silver nodes, which provide a good balance between time and XP but require frequent server switching to maximize gains.
- **Tier 9**: Not covered in detail here; referenced in a separate video focused on maximizing profits.

### Detailed Mining Route Overview by Tier

| Tier      | Unlocks                | Recommended Mining Locations               | Notes                                                                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 & 1     | Copper, Coal           | Copper Glutch                             | Focus on XP grinding; copper gives better XP than coal but both are valuable           |
| 2         | Zinc                  | Tribal Forest Bear Cave                   | Multiple zinc nodes; avoid iron until tier 3                                            |
| 3         | Iron                  | Tribal Forest                            | Mine iron first, then fill inventory with zinc for XP                                  |
| 4         | Silver                | Tribal Forest, Water Cave                 | Silver is valuable; supplement with iron and zinc for inventory fill                   |
| 5         | Gold                  | Water Cave                               | Gold mining starts; continue silver and zinc mining; fill inventory for max XP/money  |
| 6         | Quartz                | Same as Tier 4-5                         | Quartz not efficient; stick to silver/gold routes                                      |
| 7         | Bigger Nodes          | Same as Tier 4-5                         | Bigger nodes take longer, no XP/money advantage                                        |
| 8         | Large Silver Nodes    | Tribal Forest, Water Cave                 | Large silver nodes provide better yields; require server hopping                       |
| 9         | *Not specified*        | See separate video                       | Focused on maximizing money                                                          |

### Additional Tips

- **Combat**: Bears near mining spots require killing; the “mule shotgun” is recommended for its effectiveness.
- **Server Switching**: Essential at higher tiers to maximize resource respawn and XP gain.
- **Selling Location**: Sell mined goods in **Bronze City** or **Silvertown (James Co Supply)** for optimal prices.
- **Avoid Cooking Meat**: Bear meat sells for low prices; cooking wastes time during mining sessions.
- **Resource Prioritization**: Always mine the highest tier resource available but fill inventory with lower-tier ores for extra XP.

### Future Video Plans

- The creator plans to produce a video on **grinding exploration skill to level 100**, expected to take about a week with 4 hours of play daily.
- Another upcoming video will showcase the **Blunderbuss variants**, which the creator is acquiring through grinding and fan purchases.
- These videos will be more in-depth and are intended as the creator’s main content focus in the coming weeks.
